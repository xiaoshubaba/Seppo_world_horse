This project contains all original data and codes for Seppo's worldwide horse gut mictobiota project.

## Original data
The directory Profile/ contains origina data for all downstream analysis.

1.HorseV3.frequency
Contains number of reads with alignments with reference genomes.

2.HorseV3.abundance
Number of reads with alignments with reference genomes, adjusted with genome length.

3.HorseV3.Relative.abundance
Relative abundance of species in HorseV3.abundance

4.HorseV3.CAZY.profile
Number of reads with alignments with CAZY enzymes, adjusted with gene length in each family.

5. HorseV3.res.profile
Number of reads with alignments with antibiotics resistant genes, adjusted with gene length in each family.

## Code
Visualization codes are deposited in relative directories.
